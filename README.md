## Project Overview

In this project, I have set up a homelab environment that includes:
- **Nessus**: A Vulnerability Scanner
- **Nextcloud**: A self-hosted file sync and sharing service.
- **Jellyfin**: A media server for organizing and streaming media.
- **Collabora Online**: An online office suite.
- **Caddy**: A Reverse Proxy
- **Portainer**: Docker Container GUI
- **TrueNAS**: NAS

## Security Analysis Focus

Here, I discuss how this project relates to security analysis. This includes:

- Security measures implemented
- Challenges faced and how they were addressed

## Portfolio of Work

### Vulnerability Assessments

- [Assessment Report 1](https://nextcloud.gahomeserver.duckdns.org/s/Ce7pmGwrXFMb7Lf/download/Home%20Lab_fwelwo.pdf)
- [Assessment Report 2](https://nextcloud.gahomeserver.duckdns.org/s/B8xeHA28E6KLrsD/download/Weekly%20scan_jdxv25.pdf)

  With these assesments I found that My windows machine was the one needing the most patching with Ports being open and ICMP being an issue. My other machines have an SSL cert vulnerability that I do not know 100% if I can fix as of yet. My reverse proxy is setup to use my CA from lets encrypt so when navigated to the website uses my primary cert. I hava all websites self signed but it looks like the vulnerabliltiy is still popping up so I would need a CA in order for them to go away. Besides the few medium level and low level vulnerabilities my home lab is secure and up to date.
