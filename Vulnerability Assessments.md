Upon reviewing the network assessments, it has been determined that the Windows machine requires the most immediate attention. Key issues identified include several open ports and ICMP-related concerns that need to be addressed. Additionally, while other machines on the network are exhibiting SSL certificate vulnerabilities, it is important to note that these vulnerabilities are compounded by the use of self-signed certificates across all websites.

Currently, the reverse proxy is configured with a Certificate Authority (CA) from Let’s Encrypt, which serves as the primary certificate for website navigation. However, the existing use of self-signed certificates continues to present security vulnerabilities. To fully resolve these SSL certificate issues, it may be necessary to implement a properly established Certificate Authority (CA).

Despite these challenges, medium- and low-level vulnerabilities are being effectively managed. The home lab infrastructure remains secure and is kept up-to-date. Regular security scans are conducted on a weekly basis to promptly identify and address any emerging vulnerabilities.

Additionally, it is worth noting that the Windows machine’s IP address has been updated following the installation of a new 2.5GbE Ethernet card. The previous IP address (10.0.0.2) has been replaced with a new IP address (10.0.0.212), which has been adjusted to accommodate the new network configuration.
