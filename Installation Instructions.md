# Installation Instructions

## Wazuh

Since I am using Wazuh for all local computers I decided to stick with the regular installation instead of setting up the reverse proxy.

Step 1. Make sure you linux system is completely up to date by using apt update & upgrade

``` sudo apt update && apt upgrade ```

Step 2. Navigate to the Wazuh website and choose the way you'd like to install Wazuh. Here i will be showing you how I installed it on the host system using Ubunut Lixus
