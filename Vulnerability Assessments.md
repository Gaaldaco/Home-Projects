Upon reviewing the assessments, it was determined that the Windows machine requires the most attention. Notably, it has several open ports and issues with ICMP that need to be addressed. The other machines in the network have SSL certificate vulnerabilities. Although I am not entirely certain how to resolve these issues at this time, it is worth noting that my reverse proxy is configured to use my CA from Letâ€™s Encrypt, resulting in the primary certificate being used for website navigation.

Currently, all websites utilize self-signed certificates, but the vulnerability persists. It appears that a proper Certificate Authority (CA) may be necessary to fully address these issues. Despite these challenges, the remaining medium- and low-level vulnerabilities are managed, and overall, my home lab is secure and up to date. Additionally, to ensure ongoing security, scans are conducted on a weekly basis to identify and address any emerging issues promptly.

side note my Windows machine changed IP as I updated the ethernet port to 2.5gbe and did not have a static IP set for the new card. Old IP (10.0.0.2) New IP (10.0.0.212)
