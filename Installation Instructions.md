# Installation Instructions

## Wazuh

Since I am using Wazuh for all local computers I decided to stick with the regular installation instead of setting up the reverse proxy.

Step 1. Make sure you linux system is completely up to date by using apt update && upgrade
``` sudo apt update && upgrade ```
